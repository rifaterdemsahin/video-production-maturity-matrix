## 🔑 The Core Formula: PRESH

Every video follows the **PRESH** framework:

```
P — PLAN      (Pre-production: topic, audience, keywords)
R — RECORD    (Capture with defined quality standards)
E — EDIT      (Apply template, color grade, add captions)
S — SEO       (Title, thumbnail, description, tags)
H — HARVEST   (Publish + repurpose + analyze)
```
