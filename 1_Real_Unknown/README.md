## 🎬 Core Problem Statement

Rifat Erdem Sahin produces video content for YouTube and LinkedIn, but the process is **ad-hoc, inconsistent, and not systematically improving**. Without a structured framework:

- 🔴 Videos are created reactively, not strategically
- 🔴 There is no repeatable production workflow
- 🔴 Analytics are not being used to close the feedback loop
- 🔴 Time is wasted re-discovering the same solutions
- 🔴 Quality variance is high across videos

**The fundamental question is:** *How do we transform video production from a chaotic, one-off activity into an optimized, data-driven, continuously improving system?*

---

## 🎯 Core Questions

1. What is the **current maturity level** of each production dimension?
2. What does **Level 5 (Optimized)** look like for an independent creator?
3. Which dimensions have the **highest ROI** when improved?
4. What is the **minimum viable process** to reach Level 3 across all dimensions?
5. How do we measure progress **objectively** without a large team?
